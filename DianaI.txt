Hello! My Name is Diana.
The three words that would best describe me: friendly, persistent, and goofy.

One of my favorite past time activities is playing computer games. I'll play anything and I usually can't put down a game until I've finished (unless that game is Diablo). However I'm pretty sure I'd give all my games away if I could keep a puppy in my flat. I love dogs and always dreamed of having one but living in pet-free buildings has been getting in the way of realizing that dream. Some day.
